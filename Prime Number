Write a program to find wheather a given number is prime or not. A prime number is a number which has only 2 factors 1 and itself. It has not other factors. For example number 11 is prime , but number 10 is not prime because it has 1,2,5,10 as its factors.

Take n as input using scanf, Output "yes" if number is prime, otherwise print "no"





#include <cmath>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;


int main() {
    int n;
    cin>>n;
    if(n==2)
    {
        cout<<"yes"<<endl;
    }
    else
    {
        for(int i=2;i<n-1;i++)
        {
            if(n%i==0)
            {
                cout<<"no"<<endl;
                break;
            }
            else 
            {
                cout<<"yes"<<endl;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
